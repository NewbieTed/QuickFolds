## For Devs

### Setup

Go to your terminal and run:
`npm install`

This should install all the current modules needed:

We currently are using these modules:

+ _Three.js_ - a library used to render 3d scene

+ _Vite_ - a local development server that compiles well with Three.js [you can think of this as npm run dev]

Once `npm install` finishes, you can run the editor:

### Running The Editor

1. Go to your terminal and type  `npx vite`, this creates a local host server that renders any Three.js code

2. If sucessfull, you should see `VITE vX.X.XX ready...`

3. Below the message in 2., you should see text saying `Local: http:/localhost:PORT_NUMBER_HERE/`, this is where your localhost is running (usually 5173)

4. Pressing this should result in `This localhost page canâ€™t be found`. _THIS IS INTENDED_. Vite is looking for a index.html file (the "base file" in any web server). However, with multiple people working on this at once, we won't do this [and it's also good practice]. Instead, you can access the file you want putting the directory path`http:/localhost:PORT_NUMBER_HERE/PATH.html`

5. To open the editor, type in `http:/localhost:PORT_NUMBER_HERE/Frontend/public/editor.html`. Normally, you can just do `/editor.html` without the directories in front, but because we have both front-end and back-end at the same time, Vite doesn't see the `public/` directory inside frontend, so we have to manually list it.

6. The editor should appear and you should be good to go


### Editor Settings

Here are the current things you can do in the editor when looking around

+ Pressing Left Mouse Button: Let's You rotate the camera around a center point

+ Pressing Left Mouse Button + Pressing Shift: Allows you to move the point/camera itself in space

+ Pressing 'p': hides the center point the camera rotates from

+ Presssing 'r': resets the rotating point back to origin
