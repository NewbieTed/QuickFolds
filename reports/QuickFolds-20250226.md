# Progress and issues:

#### Team Member 1: Yixuan Wang

Action Items/What you did: Implemented the /fold API, tested the API with Postman, wrote tests for OrigamiService.

Result (What worked/What didn’t): All tasks are completed without any issues.

What did you learn: Setting up DB tests on GitHub Actions, testing with more automation.

Any Current Issues: N/A

Team Discussion if still having issues: N/A


#### Team Member 2: Hinyeung Lam

Action Items/What you did: Implemented the signup/login feature on frontend, refine the token-based signup/login APIs on backend, add searching feature of origami by author on frontend

Result (What worked/What didn’t): All tasks are complete.

What did you learn: More familiar with the connection between frontend and backend, and how to manage the security of token-based session authentication using springboot framework.

Any Current Issues: N/A

Team Discussion if still having issues: N/A


#### Team Member 3: Bernice Tian

Action Items/What you did: Implemented the /getStep API for annotate steps

Result (What worked/What didn't): We assumed that the /getStep API would be able to reuse some already created methods to implement its logic, but this was actually not the case since this API focuses on retrieving data from the DB while other APIs focus more on inserting data into the DB. As a result implementation took longer than expected and no tests have been written yet.

What did you learn: How to use MyBatis result maps, Java streams, a lot more familiar with SQL queries now.

Any Current Issues: N/A

Team Discussion if still having issues: N/A
